You want to determine the number of cities in a given region that have a population strictly greater than 10,000. To do this, you write a program that first reads the number of cities in a region as an integer, and then the populations for each city one by one (also integers).

//Example

//Input

6
1000
5000
15000
4780
0
23590

//Output

2


#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
	int cities;
	int pop;
	int num_count = 0;
	int i = 0;
	
	scanf("%d",&cities);
	for(i=0; i<cities; i++) {
	    scanf("%d\n",&pop);
	    if(pop > 10000) {
	        num_count = num_count + 1;
	    }
	}
	printf("%d",num_count);
	
	return 0;
}
